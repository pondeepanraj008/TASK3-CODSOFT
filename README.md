# TASK3-CODSOFT
 Iris Flower Classification model was built by me for my codsoft data science internship.To classify flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions, I employed machine learning methods such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN.All these are classification algorithms, and they aid in the classification and prediction of  floral species as given.
 Used machine learning (ML) to build a predictive model that can identify the species of iris flower based on measurements of the sepal and petal.
